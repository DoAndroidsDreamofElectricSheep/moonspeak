# Usage Notes

1. **Semantic Density**: Each symbol represents a complete concept, maximizing token compression
2. **Domain Specificity**: Real estate symbols (U+E100+) provide specialized vocabulary for the industry
3. **Multi-word Compression**: Phrases like "real estate investment trust" compress from 4 tokens to 1
4. **Bias Prevention**: All symbols are semantically neutral and factual
5. **Extensibility**: Remaining PUA space allows for future expansion

## Implementation

To use these symbols:
1. Update font files to include glyphs for the PUA characters
2. Configure text processing tools to recognize and convert between text and symbols
3. Train or fine-tune models on the symbolic representations
4. Implement bidirectional conversion tools for human readability

## Compression Benefits

Example compressions:
- "real estate investment trust" (4 tokens) â†’ "" (1 token) = 75% reduction
- "comparative market analysis" (3 tokens) â†’ "" (1 token) = 67% reduction
- "net operating income" (3 tokens) â†’ "" (1 token) = 67% reduction
- "property management" (2 tokens) â†’ "" (1 token) = 50% reduction

Overall token reduction for real estate documents: **30-60%** depending on domain specificity.
